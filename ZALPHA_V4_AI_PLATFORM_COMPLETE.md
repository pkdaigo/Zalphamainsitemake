> "ZALPHA is revolutionizing Pacific hiring with AI. We're not just another job board - we're an AI-powered platform that does the work FOR employers and students. Let me show you."

### **Demo 1: AI Job Posting Generator (2 min):**
> "Watch how fast an employer can create a job posting. I'll select 'Software Developer' in 'Saipan'... add a few details... click 'Generate'... and in 30 seconds, we have a complete, professional job posting. Look at this - responsibilities, qualifications, benefits, all optimized for Pacific candidates. This would take 15-30 minutes to write manually. We just did it in 30 seconds."

### **Demo 2: AI Video Script Generator (2 min):**
> "Now let's say this employer wants a company video. Most employers skip this because it's too much work. Not on ZALPHA. I'll enter their company info... click 'Generate Video Script'... and boom - complete word-for-word script with shot suggestions and filming tips. They literally just need to read this on camera. Companies with videos get 5x more applications."

### **Demo 3: AI Resume Builder (2 min):**
> "Now let's flip to the student side. Students struggle with resumes. Watch this. I'll enter basic info - name, email, target job, a few skills... click 'Generate Resume'... and we create a professional, ATS-optimized resume. It even gives them a score - 87 out of 100. This resume would cost $100-300 from a professional writer. We just did it in 2 minutes for free."

### **Demo 4: AI Chat Moderation (2 min):**
> "Here's the secret sauce - revenue protection. All messages are monitored by AI. Watch what happens when I try to type a phone number... it gets redacted automatically. The user sees a warning. Three strikes and they're suspended. This prevents employers and candidates from circumventing the platform. We keep ALL transactions on-platform, protecting our commission."
