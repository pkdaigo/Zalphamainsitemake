## FAQ

**Q: Why focus on keeping graduates local instead of helping them find ANY job?**  
A: Because brain drain is destroying Pacific communities. We believe graduates can build great careers AND stay close to family/culture. That dual benefit is our differentiator.

**Q: What if a student genuinely wants to leave for mainland opportunities?**  
A: That's their choice. We just want to ensure they have LOCAL options too. Currently, 70% leave because they think they HAVE to — not because they want to.

**Q: How does this create business value vs being purely philanthropic?**  
A: Regional retention creates network effects (more students stay → more employers join), defensibility (deep community trust), and ESG premium valuations. It's profit + purpose.

**Q: Will schools/investors care about this messaging?**  
A: Absolutely. Schools have a mission to serve their communities. Investors increasingly care about ESG impact. And everyone understands the importance of family.
