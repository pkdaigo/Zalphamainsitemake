When a product is in Private Beta, it is still considered to be under development. While some customers may have access, this access sometimes includes a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

**Characteristics:**
- The product is under active development with limited customer access
- May include an NDA requirement
- Early adopters provide critical feedback for development
- Access by invitation only

### 🔐 Limited Beta
**Status:** Publicly Announced, Controlled Access

A Limited Beta is still under active development, but has been publicly announced, and is potentially available to a limited number of customers.

**Characteristics:**
- The product is under active development and has been publicly announced
- Limited customer access - may include an NDA
- Used when there is a need to control adoption of a feature
- Additional guidance may be required for known caveats
- Underlying capacity may be limited

### 🌐 Public Beta
**Status:** Publicly Available for Testing

Once a product has been publicly announced, optionally tested in the field by selected customers, and meets quality standards, it is considered to be in the Public Beta phase.

Public Beta is the final phase of the release cycle before a product goes GA (General Availability). At this stage the product can be used by a wider audience for load testing and onboarding.

**Characteristics:**

- Migration guidance to alternative features
- Support during transition period

---

### 🌅 Sunset
**Status:** End of Life
