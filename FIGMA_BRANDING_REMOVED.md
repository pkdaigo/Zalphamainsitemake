## 🔍 What About "figma:asset" Imports?

**IMPORTANT:** The `figma:asset/` imports in your code (like `import img from "figma:asset/abc123.png"`) are **NOT branding** - they're technical virtual module paths used by the build system. These are internal and **never visible to users**. They:

- ✅ Don't appear in URLs
- ✅ Don't appear in the browser
- ✅ Are compiled away during build
- ✅ Are purely for the bundler

**You don't need to change these!** They're like `node_modules` - technical infrastructure, not visible branding.

---

✅ Design tool references use generic terms: "Adobe XD", "Canva", "Adobe Suite"

### `/index.html`
- ✅ Already perfect! Only mentions "ZALPHA"
- ✅ Title: "ZALPHA - Pacific Job Connection Platform"
- ✅ All meta tags branded correctly

### `/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`
- This is an internal file, not visible to users

### `/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.tsx`
- Protected file (auto-generated)
- Contains internal comment about "Figma Make data"
- **Never visible to users**
- Technical infrastructure only
