## 🎤 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q: How are you different from Indeed?**
**A:** "Indeed is a global job board with no verification, no Pacific focus, and no training. We verify every student with dual ID, offer Pacific-specific cultural training, and provide AI tools that help employers create custom assessments in minutes. Plus, we're 100% free for students forever."

### **Q: How are you different from Handshake?**
**A:** "Handshake focuses on US mainland colleges. We're built specifically for Pacific Islands—CNMI, FSM, Guam, Hawaii. We have cultural sensitivity training, equipment payment options for students, and we pay schools $10-$25 per signup instead of charging them."

### **Q: Why would students choose equipment over cash?**
**A:** "Many Pacific Island students don't have laptops or tablets for schoolwork or job applications. By offering equipment equal to their earnings value, we help bridge the digital divide and give them tools they actually need for career success."

### **Q: How do you make money?**
**A:** "Employers pay $99-$499/month depending on their needs, or they can start free with our Contract Work tier. Students are 100% free. Schools earn passive revenue ($10-$25 per signup) to support career services."

### **Q: What's your target market size?**
**A:** "50,000 students across CNMI, FSM, Guam, and Hawaii, and 2,000+ employers in hospitality, tourism, retail, and tech sectors. That's $150M+ in potential annual revenue at scale."

## 🚨 EMERGENCY BACKUP TALKING POINTS

**If tech fails:**
> "Let me describe what makes KiEX unique: We're the only platform that verifies every Pacific Island student with dual ID, offers AI-powered assessment tools for employers, provides mandatory cultural sensitivity training, and lets students earn equipment like laptops instead of just cash. These features directly address the credential fraud, cultural mismatches, and digital divide issues plaguing Pacific Island job markets."

**If asked about competition:**
> "Indeed has 250 million users but zero verification and zero Pacific expertise. Handshake has 20 million students but charges schools and ignores the Pacific. We're focused, verified, and free for students—serving an underserved market with purpose-built features."

**If asked about traction:**
> "We have $42,750 pledged on Kickstarter from 187 backers in just the first few weeks, validation from multiple Pacific Island schools interested in partnerships, and pre-launch interest from 20+ employers who want verified local talent."
