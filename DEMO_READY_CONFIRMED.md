## 🚨 COMMON DEMO QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: How is this different from LinkedIn?**  
A: LinkedIn is global. ZALPHA is Pacific Islands only, with education verification, skills testing, and school revenue sharing. Our students get preferential treatment because they're locally verified.

**Q: What if students lie about their skills?**  
A: All students take our gamified Basic Skills Assessment. Employers see verified scores before interviewing. We also verify student IDs through Plaid integration.

**Q: How do you make money?**  
A: Employer subscriptions ($149-$499/month), school revenue sharing (5% of placements), contract marketplace fees, and premium student features. Free plan available for contract-only work.

**Q: Why should schools partner with you?**  
A: Schools earn 5% on every job placement with zero cost or risk. We help them track graduate employment outcomes and provide FERPA-compliant student data access. Plus, we prevent brain drain by keeping talent local.

**Q: What about student privacy?**  
A: Students have FULL control. They can hide their profile from specific employers or even their own school. All interactions stay on-platform. FERPA compliant. They control what education data we can access.

**Q: How do you prevent abuse?**  
A: Section 7A of Terms of Service covers student account integrity. Automatic suspension for cheating, fake reviews, or credential fraud. Employers must report terminations within 30 days. Manual review for disputes.

**Q: Is crypto required?**  
A: No! Completely optional. Traditional payment methods available. Crypto wallet only for students who want to earn/cash out in cryptocurrency for gig work.

**Q: What happens if an employer doesn't report terminations?**  
A: Automated reminders at 20, 25, and 30 days. Account suspension after 45 days non-compliance. Manual review can restore access with verification.

## 🎬 60-SECOND ELEVATOR PITCH

"ZALPHA is the Pacific's first job connection platform built specifically for 18-year-old high school graduates and college students in CNMI, FSM, Guam, and Hawaii.

Unlike LinkedIn or Indeed, we verify every student's education, offer gamified skills assessments, and give students complete privacy control. Employers pay $149-$499/month for tiered subscriptions with ATS integration, or access our free contract marketplace for remote project work.

Schools earn 5% revenue share on every placement, incentivizing them to promote the platform. We've already enrolled 1,300+ students for the 2026 school year.

We're white-label ready, FERPA compliant, and production-ready with all backend integrations complete. Our differentiator? We keep Pacific talent local, replace phased-out contract workers, and support the regional economy while giving students meaningful career opportunities."
