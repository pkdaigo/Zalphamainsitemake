## ⚡ 60-Second Elevator Pitch

"ZALPHA is the Pacific's first job connection platform built specifically for 18-year-old high school graduates and college students in CNMI, FSM, Guam, and Hawaii. 

Unlike LinkedIn or Indeed, we verify every student's education, offer gamified skills assessments, and give students complete privacy control. Employers pay $149-$499/month for tiered subscriptions with ATS integration, or access our free contract marketplace for remote project-based work.

Schools earn 5% revenue share on every placement, incentivizing them to promote the platform. We've already enrolled 1,300+ students for the 2026 school year.

We're white-label ready, FERPA compliant, and production-ready with all backend integrations complete. Our differentiator? We keep Pacific talent local, replace phased-out contract workers, and support the regional economy while giving students meaningful career opportunities."
