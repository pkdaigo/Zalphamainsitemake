## 💡 QUICK ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

### **Q: Why DBA instead of forming a new LLC?**
**A: Three reasons:**
1. **Faster** - 1-3 days vs 1-2 weeks
2. **Cheaper** - $50-$150 vs $200-$500
3. **Easier** - Use existing EIN, bank account, business history

### **Q: Is trademark protection as strong with DBA?**
**A: YES! 100% the same protection.** The trademark owner is your legal entity (KI Manpower Services), and you operate as KiEX. This is how McDonald's, Apple, and most major brands work.

### **Q: Do I need to use both names?**
**A:**
- **Legal documents:** Yes - "KI Manpower Services DBA KiEX"
- **Marketing:** No - Just "KiEX"
- **Website:** No - Just "KiEX"
- **Contracts:** Yes - Full legal name + DBA

### **Q: Can I convert to LLC later if needed?**
**A: YES!** You can:
1. Form "KiEX Inc." later
2. Transfer trademark from KI Manpower to KiEX Inc.
3. Transfer contracts and assets
4. Common when raising VC funding

### **Q: How much will this cost?**
**A: $750-$850 minimum (DBA + DIY trademark), $4,650 recommended (with attorney).**

### **Q: How long does trademark take?**
**A: File trademark after DBA certificate (1-2 weeks). USPTO approval takes 8-12 months total.**

### **Q: What if DBA name "KiEX" is already taken in CNMI?**
**A: Try these alternatives:**
- "KiEX Platform"
- "KiEX Jobs"
- "KiEX Connect"
- "KiEX Careers"
