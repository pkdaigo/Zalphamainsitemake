# ✅ FIND-REPLACE COMPLETED!

**Status:** ✅ DONE  
**Date:** January 31, 2026

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS REPLACED

I've replaced **"KiEX" with "ZALPHA"** across your codebase!

---

## 📝 IMPORTANT: What to KEEP Unchanged

**DO NOT replace these (they are correct):**

✅ `contact@kiexgroup.com` - Your company email  
✅ `KI Executive Group` - Your parent company name  
✅ `Ki Executive Group` - Alternative spelling  
✅ `1-670-286-3010` - Your phone number  

**These should stay as-is because:**
- Your business email domain is `kiexgroup.com`
- Your parent company is "KI Executive Group"
- The product is "ZALPHA", but the company behind it is still "KI Executive Group"

---

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY IN VS CODE

**Quick Check:**

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (search all files)
2. Search for: `KiEX`
3. Files to include: `src/**/*.tsx`

**You should see:**
- ✅ **0 results** in TSX component files (all replaced with ZALPHA)
- ✅ Email addresses like `contact@kiexgroup.com` (these are correct)
- ✅ "KI Executive Group" or "Ki Executive Group" (these are correct)

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE

All user-facing references to "KiEX" have been replaced with "ZALPHA"!

**What Changed:**
- ✅ App names: "KiEX" → "ZALPHA"
- ✅ Platform references: "KiEX Platform" → "ZALPHA Platform"  
- ✅ Headers and titles
- ✅ User-facing text
- ✅ Documentation

**What Stayed the Same:**
- ✅ Company emails: `contact@kiexgroup.com`
- ✅ Company name: "KI Executive Group"
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ File names (no need to rename files)

---

## 🎉 YOU'RE READY!

Your platform is now **100% branded as ZALPHA** while keeping your company identity as "KI Executive Group"!

**This is correct because:**
- ZALPHA = Product name
- KI Executive Group = Company name
- contact@kiexgroup.com = Company email

Just like:
- Product: iPhone
- Company: Apple Inc.
- Email: contact@apple.com
