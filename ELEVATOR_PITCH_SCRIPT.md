## RESPONSE TO COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Is this legit?"
**"Absolutely! We're FERPA compliant, which means we follow strict student data protection laws. All your information is encrypted with enterprise-grade security. Plus, everything happens on our platform - we track all interactions to keep you safe. You have full control over what employers see about you."**

### "How much does it cost?"
**"Right now, nothing! Beta testers get 6 months of premium access completely FREE. After the 6 months, premium costs $10-20/month, but you'll get to decide if it's worth it. Plus, we're giving away exclusive gifts to beta testers as a thank you."**

### "What's the catch?"
**"No catch! We genuinely need feedback to make the platform better. All we ask is that you use the platform for 2-5 hours per week, test features as we roll them out, and give us honest feedback on what works and what doesn't."**

### "I don't have time right now"
**"I totally understand! The application takes just 3-5 minutes, and I can help you fill it out so it's even faster. Plus, you're already here at the job fair looking for opportunities - ZALPHA can help you find way more than just what's here today!"**

### "Can I do it later?"
**"Of course! But if you do it now with me, I can answer any questions you have and make sure you get the referral credit. Plus, the sooner you apply, the sooner you can get access if accepted!"**

### "What if I don't get accepted?"
**"Our beta is pretty open! We're looking for diverse perspectives - students, recent grads, people with different tech skill levels. As long as you're 18+, in the Pacific Islands, and interested in jobs or education, you have a great shot!"**

### "Will employers see my personal information?"
**"No! You have FULL control. You decide exactly what employers can see. We never share your phone number, home address, or personal details without your permission. The platform is designed with YOUR privacy first."**

### "Do you have remote work opportunities?"
**"Yes! That's actually one of our new features. We help connect you with global employers for remote work. We even ask about your device access and remote work interest in the application to make sure we match you properly."**

### "What about the Universal Basic Income question?"
**"Great question! We're gathering community perspectives on economic policies like UBI. It's completely OPTIONAL - you can skip it if you want. We're just trying to understand what matters to people in our community so we can advocate better."**

### "I'm not good with computers"
**"That's totally okay! I'll help you fill out the form right now. Plus, ZALPHA is designed to be easy to use - we want it accessible to everyone, regardless of tech skill level. And if you're accepted, we provide onboarding help!"**

- Finding the right educational programs
