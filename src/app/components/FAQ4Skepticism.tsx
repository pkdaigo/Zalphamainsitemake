            <p className="text-white/90 mb-3">
              Let's address the elephant in the room: <strong className="text-white">In small island communities, hiring often comes down to who you know,

              <div className="space-y-2 text-white/85">
                <p>• <strong className="text-white">Verified Skills Assessments:</strong> Every candidate takes the same tests—can't fake abilities or rely on connections</p>
                <p>• <strong className="text-white">Blind Screening Option:</strong> Employers can review skills BEFORE seeing names/photos—reduces bias</p>
                <p>• <strong className="text-white">Public Badging System:</strong> "Workforce Ready" badges visible to all employers—talent can't be hidden</p>
                <p>• <strong className="text-white">Performance Tracking:</strong> Employers can leave reviews—bad hires get exposed, good workers get recognized</p>
                <p>• <strong className="text-white">Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Hiring based on assessment scores, not "my uncle says he's good"</p>
              </div>

            <p className="text-white/90 mb-3">
              <strong className="text-white">We're not naive</strong>—nepotism won't disappear overnight. An employer can still choose to hire their nephew. 
              But ZALPHA gives them <strong className="text-white">objective data to make better decisions</strong>, and it gives qualified candidates 
              <strong className="text-white"> proof of their abilities</strong> that can't be ignored.
            </p>

              <p><strong className="text-white">ZALPHA:</strong> "My cousin AND this stranger both scored 95% on the assessment—let me interview both" → best person gets hired</p>
            </div>
            <p className="text-white/90 mt-3">
              Will some employers still hire unqualified family? Yes. But <strong className="text-white">progressive employers who want to build strong
