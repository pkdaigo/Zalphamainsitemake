## 🗣️ COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "How is this different from Indeed?"**  
A: "14 ways: ID verification, Pacific-only focus, free for students, Virtual Job & College Fairs, cultural training, crypto payments, equipment payments, AI courses, game-style assessments, and more. Indeed doesn't serve the Pacific specifically and lacks these features."

**Q: "Why would employers pay when Indeed is popular?"**  
A: "Our employers get verified Pacific candidates who've passed workforce readiness tests, cultural training for their teams, and access to Virtual Job Fairs where they meet students live. Plus, we have a free contract tier for gig work."

**Q: "What makes the dual pathway system unique?"**  
A: "We're the ONLY platform supporting BOTH career paths for high school graduates: immediate employment through Virtual Job Fairs, OR higher education through Virtual College Fairs with 38 Pacific colleges. This gives us 2x the market reach."

**Q: "Why crypto payments?"**  
A: "Perfect for the Pacific's cross-border payments, appeals to younger workforce, lower banking infrastructure in some islands. Plus, 2.5% platform fee + 1% cash-out fee = new revenue stream ($900K ARR)."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**  
A: "85% from employer subscriptions ($99-$499/mo), 10% from crypto transaction fees, 5% from advertiser sponsorships. Students always free."
