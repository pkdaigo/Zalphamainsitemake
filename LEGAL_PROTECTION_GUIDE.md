## 🚨 COMMON DBA QUESTIONS

### **Q: Can I trademark "KiEX" even though it's a DBA?**
**A:** YES! DBA works perfectly for trademarks. The trademark owner is your legal entity (KI Manpower Services), and you operate as KiEX. Examples:
- McDonald's Corporation DBA "McDonald's"
- Apple Inc. DBA "Apple Store"
- Your case: KI Manpower Services DBA "KiEX"

### **Q: Will investors care that it's a DBA?**
**A:** NO! You can always convert to a new LLC or C-Corp later if needed. Many successful companies start as DBAs. It shows you're established (not brand new).

### **Q: Do I need both names on everything?**
**A:** 
- **Legal Contracts:** Yes - "KI Manpower Services DBA KiEX"
- **Marketing:** No - Just use "KiEX"
- **Website:** No - Just "KiEX"
- **Bank Checks:** Yes - "KI Manpower Services DBA KiEX"

### **Q: What if I want to form a new company later?**
**A:** Easy! You can:
1. Form "KiEX Inc." later
2. Transfer the trademark from KI Manpower to KiEX Inc.
3. Transfer all contracts and assets
4. This is common when raising VC funding

### **Q: Is the trademark protection as strong?**
**A:** YES! 100% as strong as if you formed a new entity. The USPTO doesn't care about your business structure - only that you have legal right to the name.

## 🔐 PROTECTING YOUR TRADE SECRETS

**What are Trade Secrets?**
- Your source code
- Your matching algorithms
- Your database structure
- Your business strategies
- Your employer/student lists

**How to Protect:**
1. ✅ Keep code in private repositories (GitHub private)
2. ✅ Use NDAs with all team members
3. ✅ Limit access to sensitive data
4. ✅ Use IP assignment agreements
5. ✅ Don't publicly share algorithms
6. ✅ Mark documents "CONFIDENTIAL - KI Manpower Services"

**⚠️ Trade Secret Protection = NO COST!**
Unlike patents, trade secrets are free and last forever (as long as they stay secret).
