## ❓ FAQ

### For Investors

**Q: What's your unfair advantage?**  
A: First-mover in a $29.8M market with zero direct competitors, plus government priority alignment reduces regulatory risk.

**Q: How do you plan to scale?**  
A: Network effects (more students → more employers → more students), school partnerships create sticky referrals, proven SaaS model.

**Q: What's your exit strategy?**  
A: Acquisition by national job platforms (Indeed, LinkedIn) seeking Pacific expansion, or continue as profitable regional leader.

### For Employers

**Q: How is this different from Indeed or LinkedIn?**  
A: We're specifically for Pacific islands with dual ID verification, cultural training, gamified assessments, and student reviews. Plus 70% cost savings.

**Q: What if students don't use the platform?**  
A: We partner with schools who incentivize student sign-ups (revenue sharing), plus we're 100% free for students (vs. competitors charging fees).

### For Schools

**Q: What's the catch? Why is it free for us?**  
A: We make money from employer subscriptions. You help us reach students, we pay you commissions. Simple revenue sharing.

**Q: How much work is this for our career services team?**  
A: Minimal. We handle all the technology and employer relationships. You just promote ZALPHA to students, which you'd do anyway.
